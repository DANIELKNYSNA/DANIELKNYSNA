- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DANIELKNYSNA
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in in web development. Making beautiful, responsive web apps to suit all clientâ€™s needs.
- I am a relatively accomplished JavaScript dev and while I can certainly use the React.js library, my love falls on Vue.js
- I have a relatively large repo of Vue.js projects, both followed and created for you to use and peruse. Hope you find something interesting or useful.
